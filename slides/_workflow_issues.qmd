## Issues {.smaller}

Both GitHub and GitLab have methods for tracking issues.

These are useful for organising work.

- managing separate tasks
- logging new issues as they arise
- tracking and scheduling development

Example issue log on GitHub: [Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/issues)\

::: {.aside}
NOTE: Issues are part of GitHub/GitLab, NOT the git repository.\
They will not be kept if you move the project elsewhere and do not appear on your
local system.

## Exercise - Issues {.smaller}

It would enhance the _pyndulum_ code if we added functions to calculate:

- pendulum total energy, and
- pendulum length from desired period.

\

We will open issues for these on the online repository.

::: {.aside}
Extension: Beyond the scope of today's course you can also use
[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)
to further organise your work.
